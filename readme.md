# Bitcoin price prediction using BERT based Sentiment Analysis
The project focuses on developing a machine learning model that leverages sentiment analysis of Twitter data, processed by Fin-BERT and Twitter-Roberta, to predict Bitcoin prices effectively. By evaluating the effectiveness of these fine-tuned language models in capturing both financial and social media sentiment surrounding Bitcoin, the aim is to gain deeper insights into the relationship between Twitter sentiment and Bitcoin price fluctuations. Ultimately, this research seeks to provide valuable information for investors and market analysts, empowering them to make more informed decisions within the dynamic Bitcoin market.
